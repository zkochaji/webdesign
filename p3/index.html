      <h3> Corgi Means 'Dwarf Dog' </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="box1">
      <div id="textbox1">
        <p> Their name comes from the Welsh language. Cor is for “dwarf” and Gi means dog, so every time we speak the name of this breed we’re really saying “Dwarf Dog.” </p>

        <h3> They Come in Lots of Colors </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="box2">
        <div id="textbox2">
          <p> Most people think of one or two color schemes when it comes to a corgi, but the Pembroke and cardigan actually vary quite a bit. Colors include sable, merle, tri-colored, red, black, brindle, and fawn with white markings. </p>

      <h3> They Share Ancestry with Huskies </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="box3">
      <div id="textbox3">
        <p> You’d never guess by looking at them, but these squat dogs share a common ancestry with the formidable Siberian husky. They have less in common with dogs their size and more in common with their larger canine brethren. They might not pull a sled (or be able to navigate snow) but they have that same dogged determination. </p>

      <h3> Stealing a Corgi = Fines </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="box4">
      <div id="textbox4">
        <p> If you stole a corgi under ancient Welsh law, you’d get fined. There were severe penalties for abducting one of these little canine co-workers, which shows the respect they’ve held throughout history. </p>

      <h3> Corgis are Very Intelligent </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="box5">
      <div id="textbox5">
        <p> While they may not make our list of the top 10 smartest dogs, corgis are pretty sharp. The corgi may just be the Sherlock Holmes of the dog world: brilliant and genteel, with energy and ego to match. If you can keep up, this one’s for you! </p>
