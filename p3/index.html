			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="whitespace1"></div>
		<div class="name">Their name comes from the Welsh language. Cor is for "dwarf" and Gi means dog, so every time we speak the name of this breed we're really saying "Dwarf Dog."</div>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="whitespace1"></div>
		<div class="colors">Most people think of one or two color schemes when it comesto a corgi, but the Pembroke and cardigan actually vary quite a bit. Colors include sable, merle, tri-colored, red, black, brindle, and fawn with white markings.</div>

				<div class="theyshare">They Share Ancestry with Huskies</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="whitespace1"></div>
		<div class="ancestry">You’d never guess by looking at them, but these squat dogs share a common ancestry with the formidable Siberian husky. They have less in common with dogs their size and more in common with their larger canine brethren. They might not pull a sled (or be able to navigate snow) but they have that same dogged determination.</div>

				<div class="size">Stealing a Corgi = Fines</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="grayspace1"></div>
		<div class="sizetext">If you stole a corgi under ancient Welsh law, you’d get fined. There were severe penalties for abducting one of these little canine co-workers, which shows the respect they’ve held throughout history.</div>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="whitespace1"></div>
		<div class="img6text">While they may not make our list of the top 10 smartest dogs, corgis are pretty sharp. The corgi may just be the Sherlock Holmes of the dog world: brilliant and genteel, with energy and ego to match. If you can keep up, this one’s for you!</div>
